# C - Sorting Algorithms & Big O

> A project from **Holberton School – Low-Level Programming** focused on implementing and understanding different **sorting algorithms** and analyzing their performance using **Big O notation**.

**Team:** Fahad Saud alshammari & Abdullah Nasser Abdullah

## Project Overview

This project introduces several classic sorting algorithms and teaches how to:
- Implement sorting algorithms in C.
- Analyze time complexity using Big O notation.
- Identify the best algorithm based on input size and stability.
- Understand and compare algorithmic efficiency.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
1. At least four different sorting algorithms.
2. What Big O notation is and how to evaluate time complexity.
3. How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input.
4. What a stable sorting algorithm is.
